# üìä Internship Report: Mobile Phone Usage Detection

## Introduction
**Internship Title:** In-House Internship at Charusat University, Anand, Gujarat  
**Project Title:** Enhanced Real-Time Surveillance: Object Detection Models for Mobile Phone Usage Monitoring in Restricted Zones 
**Duration:** 4 weeks  
**Interns:**  Jaitej Singh and Krisha Zalaria  

This internship focused on developing automated techniques for detecting mobile phone usage, specifically in restricted zones like classrooms. Using various state-of-the-art object detection models, the goal was to enhance surveillance practices and mitigate associated risks. The internship spanned four weeks and included hands-on projects, practical insights, and real-world application of AI technologies.
